			IMAGE PROCESSING(Filter and Crop of BMP files)
Objective: To use Verilog for image processing.

We will be using Verilog as it is an RTL idea. We will use Behavioural modelling

Functionality:
First, we will convert the .bmp file(of definite pixels) to a .hex file as Verilog cannot read images directly(using external software for the process). Then we will first take the .hex file as a 2-D array and will separate the RGB values. Then will use known algorithms for filters like grayscale, sepia, blur, etc. Other than that we will also crop the image as per input given from testbench. At last, converting the hex file back to BMP using external software yields the desired result.
